This paper is the most recent version of my bachelor degree done in English. For my final version I needed to change in Romanian.
The final version included multiple new additions: 
	-> tests: cross obstacles, crosses and lines, real time from the environment, random obstacles at random time moments;
	-> real life test; 
	-> small reworks of the algorithms;
